<h1>To train the models</h1>
<p align="justify">
  we povide an implementation of dialog act classifier using two types of embedding : the GloVe and Keras Embedding and a sequence labeling neural network BiLSTM. we are trying to compare different approaches yielding to the best results. In all cases, we used the MRDA Data explained in details in the Section Datasets.
    to replicate the results, please make sure of the following things :
           1- the paths pointing to data are corresponding to the right location
           2- You dispose of suffcient computational resources
